🌟 Tavern Verse of Caution 🌟

Ye merry souls who enter here,

A tale of caution, lend an ear.

In cups of mead and laughter drown,

But heed the rules of this renowned town.

  

✨ A Wand's Spark or a Sword's Gleam,

Shall be deemed a dreadful scheme.

Beware the magic, sharp and slick,

Or Officer Thorne might work his stick.

  

🔮 Magic's Fine, but Keep it Low,

Or face a fate, you wouldn't know.

A nod to Thorne, the vigilant knight,

Your fun may end in a frosty night.

  

🍷 No Flirtatious Tricks with Serving Lasses,

A warning to all, who raise their glasses.

A playful wink, a charming glance,

But cross the line, and you've no chance.

  

🚽 To the Privy for Nature's Call,

Not the corners, where dignity may fall.

Officer Thorne frowns, no humor found,

Respect their space, let manners abound.

  

🏰 So Raise a Glass, but Keep it Chill,

No enchantments, no wicked thrill.

In Silverymoon's heart, where stories are spun,

Follow the rules or be on the run!
