Shar (pronounced: /ʃɑːr/ shahr pronounced: /ˈʃɑːr/ SHAHR), also known as Mistress of the Night and the Lady of Loss, was the goddess of darkness and the night in the Faerûnian pantheon and the malevolent twin sister and counterpart to the goddess of the moon, Selûne. She was the goddess of darkness, not only as the absence of light but also as the metaphorical darkness that dwelled in one's heart, mind, and soul. The domain of the Mistress of the Night was not only that of dark places, but of deeds done under darkness, of secrets, loss, hidden pain, and wanting to forget.

In religious artwork, Shar was depicted as a darkly beautiful elven woman with long raven-black hair and clad all in black, swirling attire. Her eyes were large and haunting, and were solid purple with pupils as black as coal and reflecting the void at the dawn of time, and when she smiled it was cold as night. When visiting mortals in dreams, her dark hair would move and swirl regardless of gravity or outside forces, such as wind.

An alternative image was that of a simple black sphere limned in rushing purple flames; these were typically magically animated.


### Personality

A force of destruction and darkness, the very existence of Shar was paradoxical; the Nightbringer was brought into existence by the creation of Realmspace, but was the living embodiment of the void, the perfect nothing that existed before she was born. The emptiness that she originally reflected had itself been erased at the start of time, and she longed to return to the ancient calm of nonexistence. And so she would disrupt order, bring down established systems, and undo everything.

By her very nature, Shar was defined by loss, the foolishness of hope, and life's inherent emptiness. She was a goddess of pains and wrongs kept hidden yet never forgotten, of concealed hatred and unnatural desires that lurked in one's heart, of nursed grudges and hungered-for revenge cultivated in secret for any slight or offense, however old and cold it was. She enjoyed concealing things and keeping secrets for their own sake, so they never saw the light of day. Her tools were temptation, subterfuge, trickery, clandestine deals, schemes, and manipulations and, to her, the means were always justified by the ends. (Despite some similarities, Shar and Leira had a subtle yet distinct difference: Shar was a goddess of secrecy and concealment; Leira was a goddess of deceit and disguise.)

The depths of Shar's evil were too extreme to be described by words. She was deeply twisted and perverse, a being of ceaseless, petty hate and jealousy. She plotted from the shadows to undermine all creation. Though she was not chaotic herself, like her sister was, Shar nonetheless sought to destroy all order. Even her own devoted worshipers were simply pawns in her overarching scheme against everything there ever was and ever would be.

Although Shar purported to be a healer, soothing the grief-stricken by letting them forget their woes, she was in truth a sadist, and enjoyed inflicting the pain of loss on her worshipers. Her alleged help was not release from that pain, but numbness to it, the acceptance of it as normal and the removal of any expectation otherwise. The Lady of Loss did not truly believe in healing grief, not even her own, but in harnessing it, in nurturing spite, nursing indignity, and reinforcing regret until minor slights, at least in one's own mind, become transgressions worthy of bitter vengeance. She taught her faithful to be cynical, that they could not look for any good in the world, nor in themselves.


### Abilities

Most notable among her array of powers was the ability to perfectly perceive every thing, every person, and every deed of betrayal or nihilism that was hidden or done in the dark. She could also instantly create any magical item that concealed or obscured what was true or that conjured magical darkness.


### Activities

Shar was in constant conflict with Selûne, her sister and the goddess of the moon. Their war was the eternal drama of the sky, vital to the balance of nature: the dark of the night devouring the light of the moon, before the moon was renewed and the cycle repeated. In their never-ending struggle across the sky, Selûne was slain by Shar at every new moon. They fought incessantly to undercut the other. Shar spent most of her energy and attention on this eternal conflict, but rather than assault Selûne directly, she preferred to target what her sister loved, such as her faithful.


### Relationships

Her eternal enemy was her sister Selûne, goddess of the moon, a war that had been waged since before all other Faerûnian gods existed, before time was recorded. They fought constantly in all realms of existence, across the sky at night and in other planes, waged through their mortal followers and their servitor beings, and in person. Selûne labored always to thwart Shar's dark plots. They would never forgive and never forget.


### Symbol

Her holy symbol was a black disc ringed with deep purple.

In the time of ancient Netheril, Shar had two different holy symbols. One was a glistening eye, purple with a black pupil and outlined in black. The other was a cowled cloak designed for hunting, black and plain and spread out flat.


### Worshipers

People turned to Shar's dark embrace in order to forget, whether it was pain at the loss of a loved one or bitterness at a betrayal. Those who were blind, particularly blinded later in life by the cruelty or carelessness of others, would also pray to her for guidance. The mentally ill and the mad, and the anarchistic and the nihilistic, might also turn to her if they had a natural affinity for her ways. Those sunk deep in depression would also pray to Shar. Though they all knew her to be dark and vindictive, they came to her anyway in the desperate belief that she and her clergy would give solace, not thinking they would use their feelings to corrupt them. Good priests, especially those of Selûne, Mystra, and Lathander, warned them away, but often in vain. In this way, the clergy of Shar grew. Ultimately, they were simply consumed by bitterness, loss, and vengefulness. She was also venerated, or at last paid lip service, by beings who avoided or despised light, those who operated at night like thieves and killers, and those with something to hide or bury.

However, folk who only had to work at night or in the dark, such as miners, would offer prayers to Shar to keep dangers at bay. Even those who'd simply lost something might beg her help finding it. So, she might be worshiped by people of any morality, whether lawful or chaotic or even good, but most often by those of evil nature, such as villainous thieves.

Although she was an elven deity, Shar was also commonly worshiped by humanoids and also creatures who abhorred light, whether it was because they lived underground or they acted at night. Either way, they paid her homage when working in the dark.

The clergy of Shar were a secretive organization that pursued subversive tactics rather than direct confrontation with its rivals. In many cities where worshiping Shar was barred, these churches and temples were hidden because of their illegal nature. In addition to her clerics, Shar maintained an elite order of sorcerer monks, the Order of the Dark Moon.


### Heresies

Those who believed in the Dark Moon heresy believed that Shar and Selûne were two faces of the same goddess.

The She-Spider Cult of Thay tried to combine the faiths of Shar and Lolth, but both goddesses ultimately rejected them, leaving them no divine aid.
